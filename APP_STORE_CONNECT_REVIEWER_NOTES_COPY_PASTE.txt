=========================================
Copy this if you need to provide more details:

HOW PERSONALIZATION WORKS WITHOUT SIGN-IN
----------------------------------------

This app personalizes to each user without requiring traditional sign-in by using:

1. Device-Based Identity
   - Each device gets a unique identifier automatically (UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor)
   - No user input required
   - Persists across app launches
   - Each device is tracked separately

2. Local User Profile
   - Users can set their name, avatar photo, and preferences in Settings → Profile
   - Stored locally on device (SwiftData)
   - Used for personalization (welcome messages show user's name, avatar displayed)
   - All user data (journal entries, prayers, progress) is stored locally per device

3. Automatic CloudKit (Optional)
   - If user is already signed into iCloud on their device, CloudKit automatically uses their Apple ID
   - No separate sign-in prompt needed
   - Enables syncing across user's devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
   - Falls back to local-only if no iCloud account
   - Works perfectly either way

PERSONALIZATION FEATURES:
- Welcome messages show user's name ("Welcome Back, [Name]!")
- Avatar displays user's photo or name initial
- Only shows that user's journal entries, prayers, progress
- User-specific statistics and analytics
- Preferences saved per user (theme, notifications, etc.)

RESULT:
Users get a fully personalized experience without needing to create an account or enter credentials. The app works immediately and personalizes using the device identity and local profile storage.
