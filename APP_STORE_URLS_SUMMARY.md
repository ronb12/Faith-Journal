## ⚠️ Privacy Policy URL (REQUIRED for App Store Submission)

You MUST have a Privacy Policy URL. Options:

### Option 1: Create PRIVACY_POLICY.md in GitHub (Free)
1. I've created `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` in your project folder (already extracted from your app)
2. Commit it to your GitHub repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages (free hosting)
4. Your URL will be: `https://ronb12.github.io/Faith-Journal/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`

**OR** create a simple `privacy.html` page and host it on GitHub Pages:
```
https://ronb12.github.io/Faith-Journal/privacy.html
```

### Option 2: Use GitHub Raw Content (Quick & Free)
If you just add `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` to your repo, you can use:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronb12/Faith-Journal/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md
```
⚠️ Note: This shows raw markdown, but it's functional and free

### Option 3: Create a Simple HTML Page
Create a `privacy.html` file, add it to your repo, and use GitHub Pages.
