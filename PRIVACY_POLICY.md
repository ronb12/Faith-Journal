- Send you notifications (if you opt in)
- Respond to your support requests

## 4. Data Storage and iCloud

Your data is stored locally on your device and synced to Apple's iCloud service when you enable iCloud sync.

By using iCloud sync:
- Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Your data is stored on Apple's servers
- Your data is subject to Apple's iCloud Terms and Conditions
- You can disable iCloud sync at any time in your device settings

We do not have direct access to your iCloud data. Apple handles all iCloud storage and security.

## 5. CloudKit and Public Data

The App uses Apple's CloudKit to enable certain features like Live Sessions and community sharing.

When you participate in Live Sessions:
- Your session data may be stored in CloudKit's public database
- Your display name and user identifier may be visible to other participants
- Chat messages and session information are shared with session participants

You can choose to create private sessions that are not shared publicly.

## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.

We may share your information:
- With Apple (for iCloud and CloudKit services)
- With other users (only when you explicitly participate in shared features like Live Sessions)
- When required by law or to protect our rights
- In case of a business transfer or merger

## 7. Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data:
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Secure authentication methods
- Regular security assessments

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

You have the right to:
- Access your personal data stored in the App
- Export your data (available in Settings)
- Delete your account and data
- Opt out of data collection (by not using the App)

To exercise these rights, use the App's settings or contact us through support channels.

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.

## 10. Third-Party Services

The App integrates with:
- Apple iCloud (for data syncing)
- Apple CloudKit (for Live Sessions)
- Apple's App Store (for app distribution)

These services have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Posting the new policy in the App
- Sending you a notification (if significant changes occur)

Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
