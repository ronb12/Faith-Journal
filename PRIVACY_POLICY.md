# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** November 21, 2025

## 1. Introduction

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is stored and used when you use the Faith Journal app ("App").

**Important:** According to Apple's App Store definition, we do **NOT** collect data that is transmitted off your device in a way that allows us or third-party partners to access it. All data you create is stored locally on your device and may be synced to Apple's iCloud (if you enable it). We do not have access to your data stored in iCloud, and we do not use third-party analytics or advertising services.

By using the App, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

## 2. Information Storage and Usage

**Important Note:** According to Apple's App Store definition, we do **NOT** collect data that is transmitted off your device in a way that allows us or third-party partners to access it. All data you create is stored locally on your device and synced via Apple's iCloud service (if you enable iCloud sync). We do not have access to your data stored in iCloud.

The App stores the following information **locally on your device** for app functionality:

**Personal Information:**
- Name and email address (if you choose to provide them)
- Profile information you create

**Usage Data:**
- Journal entries, prayer requests, and mood entries you create
- Preferences and settings you configure
- App usage patterns and interactions (stored locally)

**Device Information:**
- Device type and operating system (for app functionality)
- Unique device identifiers (for iCloud syncing only)
- App version and crash reports (stored locally)

**Data Access:**
- We do **NOT** have access to your iCloud data
- We do **NOT** transmit your data to our servers
- We do **NOT** use third-party analytics or advertising services
- We do **NOT** share your data with third-party partners
- All data remains under your control on your device and in your iCloud account

## 3. How We Use Your Information

Since we do not have access to your data stored in iCloud, all information you create is used **locally on your device** to:
- Provide and maintain the App's functionality
- Sync your data across your devices via iCloud (Apple handles this)
- Personalize your experience within the App
- Send you notifications (if you opt in)
- Respond to your support requests (only if you contact us directly)

**We do NOT:**
- Access your data from our servers
- Analyze usage patterns remotely
- Use your data for advertising or marketing
- Share your data with third parties

## 4. Data Storage and iCloud

**Data Storage:**
Your data is stored **locally on your device** first. When you enable iCloud sync, your data is synced to Apple's iCloud service.

**Important:** We do **NOT** collect or have access to your data according to Apple's App Store definition. The data you create:
- Is stored locally on your device
- May be synced to Apple's iCloud (if you enable it)
- Is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Is stored on Apple's servers (subject to Apple's iCloud Terms and Conditions)
- Can be disabled at any time in your device settings

**We do NOT have access to your iCloud data.** Apple handles all iCloud storage and security. We cannot see, access, or retrieve your data from iCloud.

## 5. CloudKit and Public Data

The App uses Apple's CloudKit to enable certain features like Live Sessions and community sharing.

When you participate in Live Sessions:
- Your session data may be stored in CloudKit's public database
- Your display name and user identifier may be visible to other participants
- Chat messages and session information are shared with session participants

You can choose to create private sessions that are not shared publicly.

## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.

We may share your information:
- With Apple (for iCloud and CloudKit services)
- With other users (only when you explicitly participate in shared features like Live Sessions)
- When required by law or to protect our rights
- In case of a business transfer or merger

## 7. Data Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data:
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Secure authentication methods
- Regular security assessments

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

You have the right to:
- Access your personal data stored in the App
- Export your data (available in Settings)
- Delete your account and data
- Opt out of data collection (by not using the App)
- Disable iCloud sync in your device settings

To exercise these rights, use the App's settings or contact us through support channels.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect or have access to user data, we do not knowingly gather personal information from children under 13.

If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns about your child's use of the App, please contact us immediately.

## 10. Third-Party Services

The App integrates with:
- Apple iCloud (for data syncing)
- Apple CloudKit (for Live Sessions)
- Apple's App Store (for app distribution)

These services have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Updating the "Last Updated" date
- Posting the new policy in the App
- Sending you a notification (if significant changes occur)

Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
